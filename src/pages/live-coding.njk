<p>I
  <a href="/posts/i-ve-started-to-live-code-on-twitch-for-dev-13cn/">started live coding</a>
  on Twitch at the end of March 2020. It started off as a small experiment, and then I started getting into a groove. Initially I was live coding by myself, but then I thought it might be fun and helpful to engage with the folks that contribute to the open source project I work on,
  <a href="https://forem.com">Forem</a>, the code that runs
  <a href="https://dev.to">DEV</a>.</p>

<h2>Live Coding Pairings</h2>

<p>So I asked the DEV community if
  <a href="/posts/let-s-pair-during-a-live-coding-session-8he/">anyone was interested</a>
  in pairing and folks definitely were. I did my
  <a href="/posts/live-coding-pairing-converting-a-preact-component-to-use-hooks-75e/">first pairing with Sophia Li</a>
  near the end of July 2020.</p>
<p>The goal of these pairings is a few things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It's potentially intimidating for people to contribute to an open source project, so why not help them out?</li>
  <li>Some folks are looking to land their first role. I thought this could be a great way to give them some exposure and confidence to help them along their way to landing that first role while contributing to a real world code base.</li>
  <li>They are
    <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/">learning in public</a>
    because we are streaming on the Internet.</li>
  <li>It's fun meeting people from the community.</li>
  <li>I potentially get to learn new things as well!</li>
</ul>
<p>I have
  <a href="https://twitch.tv/nickytonline" title="Nick Taylor's Twitch Stream">my own Twitch stream</a>
  which I initially used for pairing with folks, but since the pairings are all
  <a href="https://github.com/forem/forem/">Forem</a>
  based, since Hacktoberfest 2020, I've been doing them on the
  <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thepracticaldev">DEV Twitch stream</a>. If you want to pair on something non-Forem based, we can still pair on my own stream. If you're interested in pairing, fill out the
